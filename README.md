# Completed Goals: 

* Goal 1: Create a search box that the user can input the exact name of a Pokémon and the app will display the name and image of the matching Pokémon. The "search" box here only needs to support exact matches. Use the main pokemon endpoint of the pokeapi for this. See their website and documentation for exact details.
